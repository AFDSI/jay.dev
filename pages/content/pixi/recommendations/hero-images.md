Preloading lets you tell the
browser about critical resources that you want to load as soon as possible.
Even before they're discovered in HTML! This is especially useful for resources
such as hero images that make up a large part of the initial render. 
<br><br>
Use [AMP Optimizer](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/optimize-and-measure/amp-optimizer-guide/)
as it automatically detects and preloads hero images on the page.
It also allows you to use the `data-hero` attribute to markup images on the
page manually.
