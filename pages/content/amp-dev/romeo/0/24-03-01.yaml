    headline@: Begin building for creation, design and development.
    text@: Convey facts and figures via bite-sized chunks of one or two sentences – ideal for mobile devices. Choose from different font colors for basic readability. Or add visual elements like subtle black transparent gradient overlays to ensure readability even on random background imagery, for example user generated content. On top of this, you can use short audio files on every page to provide spoken information or background music.

    headline: Create great web experiences for users across the open web
    text: Third-party JS likes to use synchronous JS loading. They also like to <code>document.write</code> more sync scripts. For example, if you have five ads on your page, and each of them cause three synchronous loads, each with a 1 second latency connection, you’re in 15 seconds of load time just for JS loading.
