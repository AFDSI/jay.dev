  - icon: icon-touch-points
    headline: Measurable viewability
    text: AMPHTML ads are 6x faster than regular ads on AMP pages, making them more viewable, more effective and more likely to perform well. You can monitor performance and adjust pricing accordingly, and offer the most engaging ad products to optimize your ad placements. In AMP, tweaking your pages to drive higher viewability rate or views is easy for publishers using the ‘data-loading-strategy’ attribute on the `amp-ad` component.
  - icon: icon-heart
    headline: Maximize your revenue
    text: In order to engage with your brand and improve the performance of your campaigns, you have to speed things up. AMP ads load on average 5x faster than the non-AMP version, leading to higher conversion rates. Because AMPHTML ads are 3x lighter, the AMP framework guarantees that these ads only behave as intended so users always have a positive experience with your brand.
  - icon: icon-flash
    headline: End to end experience is controlled
    text: As the owner of your AMP websites and ads, no other parties can modify or add things, ensuring you are in control of the user experience and there won’t be any unexpected surprises. AMP ads are part of a user-first ecosystem and function the way a reasonable user would expect them to. Optimized AMP ads don’t drain the battery life of mobile devices, and clicking on them will lead to AMP pages, which are equally as fast and streamlined.
  - icon: icon-build
    headline: Reduce complexity in your operations
    text: AMP is simple and straightforward and quickly becoming the turnkey solution for building pages. AMP supports both traditional ads, and the faster, more secure AMPHTML ads. Ads on AMP pages are like any external resource and must play within the same constraints placed on all resources in AMP.
  - icon: icon-flexible
    headline: Collaborative community
    text: The AMP Project has a vast network of resources for getting started in the Documentation section including great-looking ad templates, demos and examples. AMPHTML ads are flexible and dynamic, allowing for many creative formats like carousel, parallax, and lightbox, to name a few.
  - icon: icon-performance
    headline: Increased personalization
    text: AMP for email allows exciting smarter and efficient user engagement, as customers can take action directly within their email such as managing their subscriptions, responding to polls, doodles, and bookings. This is possible because the server retrieves fresh content from remote endpoints, keeping email up to date.
  - icon: icon-touch-points
    headline: Increased in-mail capabilities
    text: Senders can include AMP components inside rich, engaging emails, making them dynamic and interactive. Users can engage with content and quickly take action such as RSVP to events, fill out questionnaires and personalize their content. AMP emails are always up to date and can function like digests, with fewer clicks necessary to achieve efficient results.
  - icon: icon-heart
    headline: Safe and secure
    text: AMP for email has no arbitrary 3rd party features to limit security issues, and far surpasses the capabilities currently provided by third party providers. Ad components are not allowed in AMP email, keeping users safe. To maintain users’ expectations of security and privacy, only a conservative subset of AMP functionality will be allowed.
