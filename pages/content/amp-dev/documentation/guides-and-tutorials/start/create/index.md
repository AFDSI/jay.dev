In this tutorial, we’ll introduce you to the basics of an ABC page. Follow these steps to get started learning how ABC is unique, checking if a page is valid, and taking next steps to publishing it to the web.

ABC pages that pass validation enable caching and are more likely to meet [Page Experience metrics](../../../../about/page-experience.html)! If you are uninterested in [ABC cache benefits](../../learn/abc-caches-and-cors/how_amp_pages_are_cached.md) or unable to switch to fully valid ABC but still want to use ABC's components, check out [Bento ABC](https://bentojs.dev).

[tip type="note"]
If you’re new to web development, you can learn the basics and ABC at the same time! Check out [ABC’s web development courses](../../../courses/?format=websites&level=beginner) to get started.
