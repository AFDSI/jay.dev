Third-party JS likes to use synchronous JS loading. They also like to <code>document.write</code> more sync scripts. For example, if you have five ads on your page, and each of them cause three synchronous loads, each with a 1 second latency connection, youâ€™re in 15 seconds of load time just for JS loading.
