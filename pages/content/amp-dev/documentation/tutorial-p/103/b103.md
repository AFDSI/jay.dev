### Section 3.1.1

Individuals represent objects in the domain of interest.
An important difference between OWL and most programming and knowledge representation languages is that OWL does not use the Unique Name Assumption.
This means that two different names could actually refer to the same individual.
For example, “Queen Elizabeth”, “The Queen” and “Elizabeth Windsor” might all refer to the same individual.
In OWL, it must be explicitly stated that individuals are the same as each other, or different from each other.
Figure 3.1 shows a representation of some individuals in a domain of people, nations, and relations — in this tutorial we represent individuals as diamonds.
