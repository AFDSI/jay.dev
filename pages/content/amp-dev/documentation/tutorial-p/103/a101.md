Ontologies are used to capture knowledge about some domain of interest.
An ontology describes the concepts in the domain and also the relationships that hold between those concepts.
Different ontology languages provide different facilities.
The most recent development in standard ontology languages is OWL from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
Here is a good primer on the basic concepts of OWL.

OWL makes it possible to describe concepts in an unambiguous manner based on set theory and logic.
Complex concepts can be built up out of simpler concepts.
The logical model allows the use of a reasoner which can check whether all of the statements and definitions in the ontology are mutually consistent and can also recognize which concepts fit under which definitions.
The reasoner can therefore help to maintain the hierarchy correctly.
This is particularly useful when dealing with cases where classes can have more than one parent.
The reasoner can also infer additional information.
For example, if two properties are inverses only one value needs to be asserted by the user and the inverse value will be automatically inferred by the reasoner.
