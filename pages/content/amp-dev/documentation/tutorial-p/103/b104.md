### Section 3.1.2

Properties are binary relations between individuals, i.e., properties link two individuals together.

For example, the property hasFriend might link the individual Biswanath to the individual Michael, or the property hasChild might link the individual Michael to the individual Oriana.
Properties can have inverses.
For example, the inverse of hasChild is hasParent.
Properties can be limited to having a single value â€“ i.e., to being functional.
They can also be transitive or symmetric.
These property characteristics are explained in detail in Section 4.8.
Figure 3.2 shows a representation of some properties.

> Properties are similar to properties in Object-Oriented Programming.
> However, there are important differences between properties in OWL and Object-Oriented Programming.
> The most important difference is that OWL properties are first class entities that exist independent of classes.
