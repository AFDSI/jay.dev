### Section 3.1

An OWL ontology consists of Classes, Properties, and Individuals.
OWL ontologies are an implementation of Description Logic (DL) which is a decidable subset of First Order Logic.
A class in OWL is a set, a property is a binary relation, and an individual is an element of a set.
Other concepts from set theory are also implemented in OWL such as Disjoint sets, the Empty set (owl:Nothing), inverse relations, transitive relations, and many more.
An understanding of the basic concepts of set theory will help the user get the most out of OWL but is not required.
One of the benefits of Protégé is that it presents an intuitive GUI that enables domain experts to define models without a background in set theory.
However, developers are encouraged to refresh their knowledge on logic and set theory.
A good source is the first 3 chapters in Elements of the Theory of Computation by Lewis and Papadamitrious.
