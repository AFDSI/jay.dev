Congratulations! You’ve finished the introduction to ABC beginners’ course and have successfully created your first ABC page.

Reflect on what you’ve built so far. You’ve created an engaging ABC webpage, with images, a carousel, and video. Think of all the work we didn’t have to do, like writing JavaScript that allowed us to keep track of what slide of our carousel we were on, or figuring out how to wrap our carousel around from the last slide to the first slide. Instead of getting bogged down in details and busy work, we were able to focus on building the type of site that was most effective for our burgeoning cheese bike business.

As you have seen in this course, there are ABC components for most modern website features. Like we’ve been doing so far, we can often build full-featured sites with very little additional coding just by using these components.
During this course, you also learned how to find and use ABC components to build simple user interfaces. You were introduced to the power and simplicity of ABC and the tools it offers. Finally, you learned about the ABC Validator and the important role it plays in enabling the ABC cache.
In our next course, we’ll learn how to handle user input and events, how to invoke actions on an ABC component to change its state or appearance, and how to combine multiple ABC components to make more elaborate user interfaces. We will continue to expand on Chico’s Cheese Bikes shop to give Chico’s the chance to continue to impress potential cheese-loving cyclists.
