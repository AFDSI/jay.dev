This allows web developers to take advantage of pervasive multi-core processor architectures when programming their web pages to make them more performant. While the WorkerDOM library is designed for general web programming, we plan to use it in the AMP Project as well, which we will detail more below.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">The underlying Web Worker API has been available to web developers for almost a decade, but it hasn’t seen widespread adoption. One of the reasons was that the primary API for manipulating web pages, the DOM, was not available inside of workers. </span><a href="https://www.github.com/ampproject/worker-dom"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">WorkerDOM</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> changes this, thereby enabling developers to more easily port their existing applications. We hope that this will spur renewed interest in multi-threaded programming on the web, and lead to much better experiences for users down the road.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Our research has shown that single-core CPU performance for low-cost devices has not significantly increased over the last years. As a result, from a single-core point of view, mobile devices have gotten cheaper but not faster. There is significant opportunity to take advantage of the extra cores that even the least expensive CPUs provide that aren’t available to JavaScript programming by default. To make web performance truly competitive with that of native platforms, we should try to unlock this extra bit of performance to provide better and more modern experiences across the whole range of devices people use.</span></p><figure data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_2117" class="wp-caption alignnone amp-wp-inline-99a39c5730764d6fc14dd1a9ff777fcc"><amp-img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2117 amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-08-21-at-10-45-37-am.png?w=660" alt="Screen Shot 2018-08-21 at 10.45.37 AM" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-08-21-at-10-45-37-am.png?w=660 660w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-08-21-at-10-45-37-am.png?w=1320 1320w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-08-21-at-10-45-37-am.png?w=150 150w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-08-21-at-10-45-37-am.png?w=300 300w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-08-21-at-10-45-37-am.png?w=768 768w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/screen-shot-2018-08-21-at-10-45-37-am.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw" width="660" height="366"></amp-img><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Not all mobile devices are created equal.</figcaption></figure><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">WorkerDOM aims to provide a full representation of the DOM inside of Web Workers. In the ideal case this means that scripts can be used unchanged inside of the worker environment. At the heart of the library is an efficient transport mechanism written in TypeScript. It hydrates server rendered DOM and then proxies mutations as an application makes changes to the page, such as reacting to user actions or running animations.
