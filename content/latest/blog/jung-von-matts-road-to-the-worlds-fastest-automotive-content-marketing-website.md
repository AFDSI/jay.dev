		<p><i><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Posted by Thomas Feldhaus, Managing Director, Jung von Matt/NEXT ALSTER</span></i></p><p><i>Read more about BMW.com in the <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/bmw">AMP case study on AMPproject.org</a> or on Jung von Matt’s <a href="http://awardserver.de/2017/BMW_COM/">page here</a>.</i></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">“What a nice challenge!” That’s what we thought when we won the job to relaunch the digital home of BMW, <a href="http://www.bmw.com">BMW.com</a>, and to excite users by transforming the website from only a web showroom to a data driven, entertaining and helpful  state of the art automotive content marketing platform.</span></p><p><amp-anim class="aligncenter amp-wp-inline-915c8d8fcef2c87e4c01624a66d92b7f amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/InfantileIndelibleCrab-size_restricted.gif" width="250" height="375" sizes="(min-width: 250px) 250px, 100vw"></amp-anim></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Our creatives, strategists and consultants discussed every little detail of the task: digital strategies, content strategies, media strategies, social media strategies, KPIs and so on: everything needed to reach the long-term goal of getting car enthusiasts and those generally interested in mobility excited about the beauty of the BMW brand.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">As an agency well-known for creative excellence, our friends in the creative department wanted users to plunge into a digital adventure that would totally ‘wow’ them – with everything an ultramodern user experience has to provide: inspiring articles with high-res images, smooth full-screen videos and a state-of-the-art user interaction design. By setting up this seamless experience, we knew we could meet our goals of reaching users when they were interested in our content. </span></p><p><b>Let the code experts take the lead and performance will follow</b></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">There is a known cliche cliché that developers are just seen as the “code monkeys” who put a stop to any creative concept. Not in our case, because we all agreed that the critical  success factor would be: PERFORMANCE!!! </span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Our simple formula was</span><i><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> “No performance, no fun. Mo’ performance, mo’ fun!”</span></i><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> Because what’s the value of super-fancy content if it takes you ages to load on your mobile device.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">By using a technical strategy that allowed performance and visual and engaging content to coexist via the combination of AMP and PWA (</span><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Progressive Web Apps</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">), we hardly had to make any compromises. Not to mention the fact that we liked that AMP pages are linked and load quickly from all platforms, like Google Search and Twitter. </span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">So in close collaboration with UX, designers and editors we started working on the new BMW.com, with our focus turned 100% to delivering the best-ever mobile user experience.</span></p><p><b>Close collaborations and requirements for fast, engaging user experiences </b></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Every creative wish brought to our attention was checked for its feasibility with AMP. With the limitation of 50 KB in CSS, we started to research, develop and test whether a desired feature was realisable with the PWA technology. For example, we were able to implement the feature of swiping smoothly from one article to the next whilst remain super-fast – an experience users would normally only expect from a native app.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">If the team said, “There’s no chance to implement the feature without a loss of speed”, the whole agency backed our decision, because we were all committed to one divine command: </span><i><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">performance</span></i><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">It also certainly helped that during our development journey, the AMP team was friendly and helpful via Slack, GitHub and in person at conferences.</span></p><p><b>The world’s fastest* automotive content marketing website</b></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Working with AMP not only demonstrated  to us what a great technology it is, but also what is possible if the development and creative teams agree on a plan from the very first line of code. </span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">The result of all the work: a website that loads unbelievably fast. The all-new BMW.com – possibly the world’s fastest automotive content marketing website.
