		<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Last year over 300 developers came together to learn and share about the latest in AMP at AMP Conf in NYC. Since then we’ve had many new developments and uses of AMP emerge, from e-commerce functionality, to building canonically with AMP, to using AMP pages within a Progressive Web App. To share all the latest and get input on the future of the project, the AMP team decided it was time to hold the next AMP Conf.</span></p>
<amp-carousel width="600" height="480" type="slides" layout="responsive"><amp-img src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/amp3.png?w=600" width="600" height="175" layout="responsive"></amp-img><amp-img src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/amp1.png?w=600" width="600" height="400" layout="responsive"></amp-img><amp-img src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/filipwolak_amp23layers_0266_8031.jpg?w=600" width="600" height="400" layout="responsive"></amp-img></amp-carousel><p><b>With that, we’re thrilled to <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/amp-conf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invite you to join the AMP team and community at AMP Conf 2018 in Amsterdam on February 13th and 14th</a>. </b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">At AMP Conf 2.0, our core focus will be centered around UX excellence, and how to use AMP to build amazing sites (not just pages!). So expect CSS talks focused on how to achieve more with less JS, more applied knowledge around AMP components, and possibly even live coding (gasp!). And as with last year there will be plenty of time to connect with the AMP team to ask questions and share input on the project. The specific speaker line up will be announced in the coming month.</span></p>
<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"><strong>And this year, the AMP team wants to hear from even more of the community, so we <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/amp-conf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invite you to submit a talk for consideration</a>.</strong> Share the most interesting things you’ve done with AMP, your challenges with AMP in production, or even topics that aren’t about AMP but relate to building AMP pages, like how to utilize the best CSS has to offer.</span></p>
<p><strong>The event will take place all day on February 13th and 14th, so be sure to <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/amp-conf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">register</a></strong><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"><strong> and mark your calendars.</strong> And for anyone who is not able to make it in person, we’ll be live streaming the content on the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXPBsjgKKG2HqsKBhWA4uQw"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">AMP YouTube channel</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. More details on the specific venue soon, but we’re excited to see everyone in AMPsterdam.</span></p>
