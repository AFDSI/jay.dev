<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">To conduct the analysis, Forrester interviewed 4 web companies who have been utilizing the AMP format. Based on the results observed by the sites interviewed, Forrester created a model to project the expected return from implementing AMP over a three year period. Using the model, a website with 4 million site visits monthly and a 10% profit margin would expect</span><b> to win back the costs of implementing AMP and begin to see positive gains in less than 6 months</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">.</span></p>

<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Some of the topline results from the study:</span><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"><br/></span></p>
<ul><li><b>20% increase in sales conversion rate</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">. A/B testing conducted by the two e-commerce websites interviewed for this study demonstrated a 20% increase in the conversion rate on their AMP pages, which would drive over $200K in annual profit, based on the Forrester model.</span></span></li>
<li><b>10% year-over-year increase in AMP site traffic.</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> An increase in site traffic results in additional sales and ad views, which would drive over $75K in annual profit for a site in the first year, based on the model.</span></span></li>
<li><b>60% increase in pages per visit.<span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> AMP pages performed positively for e-commerce and news publishers who both said that there was a 60% increase in people coming to the site and those people spent twice as long on the site with a small increase in return visitors of 0.3%.</span></b></li>
</ul><p>AMP is still a relatively new format, and while there are costs associated with adopting it, the pay-off greatly outweighs that initial outlay. Specifically Forrester’s model found that a site with 4M visitors monthly implementing AMP could expect <b>benefits of $1,005,447 over three years, against a total investment of $210,827, yielding a 377% ROI.</b></p>
