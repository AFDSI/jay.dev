		<p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">For over two years, AMP has been a leading format for creating consistently excellent user experiences on the web, and Google continues to invest strongly in it as our well-lit path to achieving a user-first web. We’ve long believed that the goal of a user-first web can be built in many ways, but, until we began working on AMP, knowing exactly what that meant and how it could be verified was a challenge. Based on what we learned from AMP, </span><b>we now feel ready to take the next step and work to support more instant-loading content not based on AMP technology in areas of Google Search designed for this, like the Top Stories carousel.</b><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> This content will need to follow a set of future web standards and meet a set of objective performance and user experience criteria to be eligible.</span></p><p> </p><h2><b>The origins and development of AMP</b></h2><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">We started working on AMP because we were seeing the mobile web feel clunky and slow, falling behind the tightly-integrated, highly-optimized user experiences that walled garden platforms can offer. Yet we also knew there wasn’t a fundamental technology problem: you could build great experiences on the web with the right knowledge, resources, and management support. Thus we set out to create a framework that would provide a well-lit path to building great web-based experiences: AMP would be well documented, easily deployable, validatable, and opinionated about user-first principles.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">AMP has seen fast development as an </span><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">open source project</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> with weekly releases and constant adjustment to </span><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22INTENT+TO+IMPLEMENT%22"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">publisher and user feedback</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">.
