<div class="amp-wp-article-content">

		<p><em>Editor’s note: The following is an excerpt from an independent study done by <a href="http://www.stonetemple.com">Stone Temple</a>, a digital marketing agency, posted with their permission. <strong><a href="https://www.stonetemple.com/the-canonical-guide-to-amp/amp/">Read the full study here</a>. </strong></em></p>
<p>We conducted interviews of more than 10 companies that have invested heavily in AMP, to see if we could learn how hard it was to implement, the challenges people faced, the solutions they found to those challenges, and the benefits they believed they got as a result.  We decided to pursue this because we’ve worked with several clients on AMP, and so many people we discussed AMP with  were confused by one or myths, and we wanted to help set the record straight. In addition, we thought it would be helpful to the industry to have a study that was done independently of Google, so any potential bias would be minimized.</p>

<p>In this study, you will see the results of a large-scale investigation we did into AMP. I set out to learn as much as I could by speaking with 10 different companies about their experiences with AMP. These were all companies that had released an AMP implementation on a major section, or nearly all, of their pages.</p>
<p>The TL;DR, for those of you who want to avoid diving into all the details, is that for companies that followed through with a complete implementation of AMP, pretty much all had good to very strong results. However, how I’m defining a “complete implementation” might not be what you expect (you’ll have to read on to see what I’m talking about).</p>
<p>In our study, each participant shared a lot of details about their experiences with AMP, including implementation issues, and the resulting metrics. As a result, this study should help you understand:</p>
<ul><li>The potential benefits from implementing AMP</li>
<li>How much effort it will require</li>
<li>Solutions to some of the challenges</li>
<li>What your potential ROI might look like.</li>
</ul><h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Overall, I believe that AMP will offer very strong benefits to everyone who takes the time to truly do it right. And if your implementation is done with care, it can be made pretty scalable. As you’ll see in the study, the parties involved really did not spend a tremendous amount of engineering effort on AMP. Most of you who are reading this probably won’t require a ton of effort either.</p>
