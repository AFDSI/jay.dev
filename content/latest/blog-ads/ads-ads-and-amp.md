In the past year alone, we’ve seen publishers on AMP reach several milestones: they’re generating up to $6 million per week from ads using Google AdSense and Doubleclick Ad Exchange, earning 3X more revenue per day, and leveraging <a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/ads">over </a></span><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/tree/master/ads"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">100 ad tech platforms</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> supporting the open source AMP Project.<sup>1</sup></span></p><h2><amp-img class="size-full wp-image-1774 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/hero_image_2.png?w=660" alt="hero_image_2" width="660" height="209" sizes="(min-width: 660px) 660px, 100vw"></amp-img></h2><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Publishers like </span><a href="https://www.mailadvertising.co.uk/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">MailOnline Advertising</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> are implementing optimized strategies to maximize revenue on their AMP pages.

Like MailOnline and India Today, all publishers should approach monetizing their AMP pages with the same optimizations as their non-AMP pages to ensure they are capitalizing on this growing revenue opportunity.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">But we know there is still progress to be made.

Since then, the AMP Project has worked hard to bring better performance and capabilities to ads on AMP.</span></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">A key step along the way was the release of Fast Fetch, a faster mechanism for loading ads on AMP pages. Fast Fetch renders ads up to 2.7 seconds faster compared to the legacy mechanism. A lot can get done in 2.7 seconds. In fact, in 2.7 seconds, there are over 130,000 Google searches made, 140,000 YouTube videos viewed, and 5,000,000 emails sent.<sup>2</sup></span><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> Since </span><a href="https://www.ampproject.org/latest/blog/even-faster-loading-ads-in-amp/"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">announcing</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60"> Fast Fetch in August 2017, we’ve shifted our focus to making sure all AMP partners can apply the speed and performance of Fast Fetch to their own businesses.</span></p><p><amp-img class="alignnone  wp-image-1954 aligncenter amp-wp-enforced-sizes" src="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blog_faster-e1518564194551.png?w=396&amp;h=495" alt="2.7seconds" width="396" height="495" srcset="https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blog_faster-e1518564194551.png?w=396&amp;h=495 396w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blog_faster-e1518564194551.png?w=792&amp;h=990 792w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blog_faster-e1518564194551.png?w=120&amp;h=150 120w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blog_faster-e1518564194551.png?w=240&amp;h=300 240w, https://amphtml.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/blog_faster-e1518564194551.png?w=768&amp;h=960 768w" sizes="(min-width: 396px) 396px, 100vw"></amp-img></p><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Today we announced </span><a href="https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/issues/11321"><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">Real-Time Config</span></a><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">, a new component enabling publishers to implement third-party technology partners while also leveraging the speed and performance of Fast Fetch. Real-Time Config allows publishers to leverage the benefits of Fast Fetch without compromising their monetization strategy. For example, publishers can now leverage their data management platforms or server-side demand aggregators such as <a href="https://www.appnexus.com/en/blog/prebid-amp-integration-2-13-18">Prebid Server</a> on their AMP pages. </span></p><h3><strong>Expanding AMPHTML ads with new tools and partnerships</strong></h3><p><span class="amp-wp-inline-329fdb7771c10d07df9eb73273c95a60">While ad serving is one component that impacts AMP monetization—the ad creatives themselves are another.
