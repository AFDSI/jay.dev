It says that the total height of the ads on the page / total height of the content on the page should be &lt; 30%. This is of course the worst case scenario and often publishers have percentages lower than this.</p><p id="b1f4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">During my publisher interviews, three common misconceptions came up when inquiring why some didn’t have the same ad density on both AMP and non-AMP pages:</p><p><strong>1. “I didn’t realize I needed to manage ad density”</strong></p><p id="1d57" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">When probing further, the AMP model was being confused with<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/monetization/ad-placement/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"> Facebook Instant Articles’ approach</a> to ad density where there is an automated ad insertion offering. AMP doesn’t directly offer publishers a way to automatically manage ad density but it makes APIs available that allow auto-ad insertion to the 100+ ad networks natively integrated in AMP. Individual ad networks can choose to take advantage of those APIs, similar to how<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9011462?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">AdSense</a> does. For most ad networks, including DoubleClick for Publishers (DFP), such auto placement is not available and publishers must manage ad density themselves.</p><p id="f1b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong>2. “I thought there were restrictions on the number of ads I could place”</strong></p><p id="a6b2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Turns out, they were mixing AMP up with FIA’s approach, where they have a<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instant-articles/monetization/ad-placement/#manual-placement" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">policy</a> to replace manually placed ads if the ad density is greater than 20%. AMP has no such restrictions. AMP delegates the responsibility to the publisher and the individual ad network they choose in order to eliminate any AMP-specific idiosyncrasies related to ad density management.</p><p id="624a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong>3. “We didn’t optimize our AMP pages after the initial AMP launch 3 years ago”</strong></p><p id="1c06" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A lot can change over 3 years and some publishers had undergone architectural changes but their engineering teams may have forgotten to include AMP pages in the re-architecture. It’s important to keep both sets of pages at parity not only to earn the same revenue from your AMP pages but also helps you understand <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how </em>your AMP pages are performing.</p><p id="6dc8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A specific area to call out is to ensure parity on recirculation promotions that allow users to consume related content. Not having these on your AMP pages may have a negative impact on your bottom line because anecdotally these lead to 1.2 or 1.3 times session lengths. AMP supports various <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-ad#supported-ad-networks" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">3rd party recirculation</a> providers too.</p><p id="2201" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In summary, regardless of what strategy you use on your non-AMP pages, ensure you translate that strategy over to your AMP pages. There are no restrictions in AMP that would make a publisher have fewer ads on AMP pages than on non-AMP Pages.</p>	</div>
